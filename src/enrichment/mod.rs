//! Enrichment providers. A provider layers counterpart and status data from a protocol
//! API onto a transfer that was already decoded from Solana data. Enrichment can raise a
//! transfer's status but never gates persistence and never moves a status backwards.
//!
//! WormholeScan is the only provider today. A later protocol adds its own implementation
//! of [`EnrichmentProvider`] next to it.
